## Installation and usage

Download the repository and extract everything into a folder. The code has already been compiled as "STEALTH.exe", which can be run directly by double clicking it on any machine with a Windows OS. Otherwise, to compile and run the "STEALTH.c" file, type the following commands into a terminal opened in the folder where you extracted the zip's content:
```bash
  gcc STEALTH.c -o STEALTH
  ./STEALTH
```
You can now play the game :man_dancing:.
